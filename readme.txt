This plugin enables the insertion of widget areas in your post's content via programmatic insertion at display time, via a shortcode, or via blocks. Use these widget areas for ads, newsletter signups, calls to action, or anything else!

== Description ==

This WordPress plugin gives site administrators a way to insert widgets such as ads, newsletter signups, or calls to action into posts at set intervals.

The plugin registers a configurable number of widget areas.

The plugin can programmatically insert these widget areas into posts when the page is rendered. This setting can be overridden on a per-post basis via a post meta box or a filter.

If the programmatic insertion doesn't work for a particular post, users can choose to place specific widget areas at specific spots in the post using shortcodes or blocks.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin directory to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
